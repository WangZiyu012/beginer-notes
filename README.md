# function with output 
```angular2html

def function():
    do with something
    return something

# call function
output = function()
```

"return" statement implies the end of the function

# docstrings

a way for us to create documentation as going along in the function

```angular2html
def function():
    """docstrings """

```

# scope

things inside the function are blocked.
```angular2html
def fc_1():
    def fc_2():

fc_2() # can'â€  call, because fc_2 is in the scope of fc_1()

```


```angular2html

game_level = 3
enemies = ["Skeleton", "Zombie", "Alien"]
if game_level < 5:
    new_enemy = enemies[0]
print (new_enemy)
# var. inside the if loop or any other loops, it will not be scoped, it will be counted as global.
```

```angular2html

game_level = 3
def create_enemy () :
    enemies = ["Skeleton", "Zombie", "Alien"]
    if game_level < 5:
        new_enemy = enemies[0]
print (new_enemy)
# this time var. is created inside the function, so it will be scoped
```
# how to debug

1. use print()
2. use debugger python visualizer
